# Path-finding-using-DFS-and-OOP-in-Python

#Introduction
This code solves the leetcode problem #980: Unique Paths lll. 
Uses python3

#How it works
This code using some advanced programming techniques, including recursivity, DFS(Depth First Search), OOP and data structures like a Stack.

It works with python, without using libraries and applying many concepts learned through the years. To do this code I took as reference the book "Problem solving using Algorithms and data strucutres in Python" by Miller and Ranum.
